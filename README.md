<b>BACKSTORY</b>

This project was inspired by the "Restaraunt Georgia" project in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/sass-the-complete-sass-course-css-preprocessor/learn/lecture/12992372#content">Udemy SASS Course.</a> This was also when I started learning the basics of HTML, SASS, and CSS. I wanted to make my first coding project something aestethically pleasing rather than 40 lines of "Hello World" text elements, so I did this project.

<b>PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS</b>

While doing this project, I saw that SASS/CSS styles HTML, from aligning HTML text elements to even making shaped, pretty buttons out of plain, simple hyperlinks.

<b>APP OVERVIEW</b>

1. <i>Hamburger Menu:</i>
   When the icon of 3 yellow bars are clicked, a hamburger menu of the restaurant's menu will be seen. On this dropdown menu the user will find options of "Careers", "Directions", and other restaurant pages by hovering over the titles.

2. <i>Reccomended by our Chefs:</i>
   This section is composed of 6 cards of the most popular dishes of the restaurant. Hover effects are used so that when the user wants to order the item, a card listing the food item's name and price with an "Order now" button will display, letting the user more easily order the popular items the restaurant offers.

3. <i>Social Media Icons:</i>
   The restaurant is on Yelp and other social media platforms, and for users to more easily access reviews, news, and other platforms the restaurant is on, the white icons will turn into a different color to indicate that clicking the icon will lead users to the appropriate page.
   ** NOTE: None of the social media buttons will lead to any other websites - these buttons were to display simple hover effects. **

<b>TECHNOLOGIES USED</b>

HTML

CSS

<b>CHALLENGES</b>

<i>Going Ahead:</i> Initially, I tried styling too much of the web app,which made me unintentionally write faulty code. I had to rewrite the code from the beginning once, almost twice.

<i>Debugging:</i> As a beginner, I ran into CSS styling errors like placards not showing properly and misaligned text and did not know how to fix them.

<i>Ignorance and Inexperience:</i> Unsure of what actual technologies, time, and effort is needed to create an MVP that is sufficient for a proof of concept

<i>Time Management:</i> Keeping app development within 2 weeks scope - I spent 4 weeks on developing this app.

<b>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</b>

Refine Skills: Review HTML/CSS elements/functions
